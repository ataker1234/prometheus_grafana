This repository contains the configuration files of my Prometheus, Grafana and AlertManager config. 

This is just a simple, mostly default config. I am still learning about these tools, so I will probably update them in the future.

I only have 1 node in the scope now, but it will increase to 4 shortly with extra Kubernetes clusters.
